# Spacecraft Reentry Trajectory Simulation ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Welcome to the Spacecraft Reentry Trajectory Simulation repository! This project focuses on simulating and visualizing the reentry trajectory of a spacecraft as it returns to Earth's atmosphere. By considering various factors such as gravitational effects, atmospheric drag, and temperature changes due to friction, this simulation provides insights into the complex dynamics of spacecraft reentry.

## Introduction

Spacecraft reentry is a critical phase of spaceflight, where a spacecraft returns to Earth from space. During reentry, the spacecraft encounters significant drag forces and experiences heating due to friction with the Earth's atmosphere. This simulation aims to model and visualize the trajectory of a spacecraft during reentry, providing valuable insights into its behavior and environmental conditions.

## Installation

To run the simulation, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). Once Python is installed, follow the steps below:

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/Spacecraft_Reentry_Trajectory.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the repository directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
cd Spacecraft_Reentry_Trajectory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can run the simulation script to visualize the spacecraft's reentry trajectory:

```bash
python spacecraft_reentry_trajectory.py
```

This will execute the simulation and generate a 3D visualization of the spacecraft's trajectory during reentry. The visualization includes detailed information about the spacecraft's position, velocity, and temperature changes over time.

## Detailed Simulation

The simulation utilizes numerical integration techniques to solve the equations of motion for the spacecraft during reentry. It considers gravitational forces from Earth, atmospheric drag, and changes in temperature due to friction with the atmosphere. By accurately modeling these factors, the simulation provides a detailed representation of the spacecraft's behavior during reentry.

## Visualization

The 3D visualization generated by the simulation offers a comprehensive view of the spacecraft's trajectory as it descends through the atmosphere. The color of the trajectory represents the temperature of the spacecraft's surface, with cooler temperatures shown in blue and hotter temperatures depicted in red. This color mapping allows for a clear understanding of how temperature changes affect the spacecraft during reentry.
